        <h2>Adventure Travelling</h2>
        <p>Adventure is more than just a journey or travelling from places A to B. It is an extended experience that comes with risks and rewards, unpredictable twists, guaranteed obstacles and surprising results. Basically, adventure is all about change and change is growth which is the core of life.

                Stumbling Blocks in Adventure
            <br><br>
            Going on an adventure is exciting. However, let us not forget to look at the downside of adventure too. Here are few things one should be aware of before chalking up the excitement:
            <br><br>
            Adventure trips and adventure sports are fun but let us not forget they are dangerous too.<br><br>
            Adventure can be defined as a way of risking your life just for recreational purpose and thrill.<br><br>
            Even with all the safety measures within reach, the chances of getting injured cannot be barred out completely. There have been cases where people have been injured terribly and even lost their lives just while trying different adventurous activities. Many of these activities require straining the body. It can end horribly if your body is not prepared for such discomfort.<br>
            Adventures can sometimes put you in an agonizing state.<br><br>
            Since ages, adventures have been viewed as a proof of guts, daring and many a times even masculinity. So, if a person is not able to satisfactorily do the adventure, it can dent the confidence too.<br><br>
            You would not want to go out there without your equipment and gears. Even though they are for safety purpose, they are ridiculously expensive.<br><br>
            It can cause stress to our friends and family who care for us. Choosing such a dangerous thing ignoring the fact that it can take a toll on them too is certainly not good.<br><br>
            Now, to enjoy, one should be aware of all the ins and outs of the adventure. Proper training under some well qualified trainers is required. Finding time to get thorough training is not so easy in this fast paced world. Besides, it will also be a costly affair.<br><br>
            Like two sides of coin, adventure has its own pros and cons. Many a times, it’s possible that the cons would outnumber the pros – it’s not compulsory though. But, as we know, every situation can be solved with proper planning and taking precautions. As we head for adventure, we should prepare to sail through them smoothly and at the same time be prepared to face any troubles that may come. This is how adventures can be enjoyed to the fullest.</p>
